# Data of my Projects
Here I will store the data of my current projects

Right now you can find:

+ *Rubrics*: List of Middle High German rubrics in miscellany manuscripts (mostly of short texts in rhyming couplets). This is the dataset I used for my presentation at the conference ["The Medieval Literary Canon in the Digital Age"](http://www.mcda.ugent.be/). 

+ *Handschriftencensus Data*: A json list created with the information from the Handschriftencensus Website. List of works with the manuscripts which attest it.
